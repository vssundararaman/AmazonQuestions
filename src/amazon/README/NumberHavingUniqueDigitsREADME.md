Numbers having Unique (or Distinct) digits
Given a range, print all numbers having unique digits.

Examples:

Input : 10 20
Output : 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  (Except 11)

Input : 1 10
Output : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

As the problem is pretty simple, the only thing to be done is :-
1- Find the digits one by one and keep marking visited digits.
2- If all digits occurs one time only then print that number.
3- Else not.
