**A program to check if a binary tree is BST or not**

A binary search tree (BST) is a node based binary tree data structure which has the following properties.
 
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

From the above properties it naturally follows that:  
Each node (item in the tree) has a distinct key.
